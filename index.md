# coffee-gen-ai
This repository is to help me gather my thoughts and keep learning and catching up on the fast-paced field of generative AI while drinking coffee!

**Last update: Jan 9th, 2025**   
My plan to update this repository frequently as notes for my learning and readings around gen-ai. Please suggest what I should read next in the issues.
