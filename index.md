# coffee-gen-ai
This repository is to help me gather my thoughts, keep learning, and catch up on the fast-paced field of generative AI while drinking coffee!

**Last update: Jan 19th, 2025**   

My plan is to update this repository frequently with notes from my learning and readings on generative AI. Feel free to suggest what I should read next in the issues!
