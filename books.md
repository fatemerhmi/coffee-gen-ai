## Free books

Foundations of Large Language Models by Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu [book](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09223)

## paid books

1) "Hands-On Large Language Models" by Jay Alammar & Maarten Grootendorst - Excellent practical guide, Amazing Illustrations and code exmplaes [GitHub](https://github.com/HandsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models/tree/main)

2) "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" by Sebastian Raschka, PhD - Perfect for understanding core architecture. Goes into details also about e.g. data preprocessing.

3) "Building LLM Powered Applications" by Valentina Alto - Great for real-world implementation, heavy focus on using open-source libraries like LangChain

4) "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra & Thomas Wolf - Essential for understanding the backbone of modern LLMs. Naturally Hugging Face focused, which is good.

5) "Understanding Deep Learning" by Simon Prince - Amazing theoretical foundation. Has the most math, but explained in very friendly way and easy to follow step-by-step.
