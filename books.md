Foundations of Large Language Models by Tong Xiao and Jingbo Zhu [book](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09223)

## paid books

The following list is the suggestion from [Lukas Tencer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukastencer/) - [link to blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lukastencer_ai-machinelearning-llm-activity-7275253370540498944-n60H?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Here's Lukas's top 5 reading list for anyone looking to truly grasp LLM fundamentals and implementation:

1) "Hands-On Large Language Models" by Jay Alammar & Maarten Grootendorst - Excellent practical guide, Amazing Illustrations and code exmplaes [GitHub](https://github.com/HandsOnLLM/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models/tree/main)

2) "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" by Sebastian Raschka, PhD - Perfect for understanding core architecture. Goes into details also about e.g. data preprocessing.

3) "Building LLM Powered Applications" by Valentina Alto - Great for real-world implementation, heavy focus on using open-source libraries like LangChain

4) "Natural Language Processing with Transformers" by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra & Thomas Wolf - Essential for understanding the backbone of modern LLMs. Naturally Hugging Face focused, which is good.

5) "Understanding Deep Learning" by Simon Prince - Amazing theoretical foundation. Has the most math, but explained in very friendly way and easy to follow step-by-step.

This stack has been invaluable in moving from "using" to "understanding" LLMs. Hope it helps others on the same journey!
